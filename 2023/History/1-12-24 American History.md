## What does a historian do?
This is just a list of skills that historians use and give an idea of what a good modern historian does.
1. Sourcing - Historians need to know how to use sources in order to properly "create" history. The different terms below are usually in reference to what you are studying. The following below use the the experience of enslaved people in the Civil War
	1. Primary - Primary resources are the original source that information comes from. A good example is photos of formerly enslaved people building houses in army camps.
	2. Secondary - Secondary resources are secondary to the original information or event. A good example is a diary article from a person who talks about seeing an emancipated black person in his town. Note that if we are talking about this person, it would be considered a primary source.
	3. Tertiary - A second hand second hand resource. Good examples usually don't have easily findable authors. Good examples are encyclopedias (including wikipedia) and textbooks. These can have a bad wrap, but can actually be good to aggregate information (and sources!).
2. Corroberation
	1. Corroborating is strengthening the information that comes from sources. Good examples of this include many sources that include the same information or other ways to determine the reliability.
3. Contextualization
	1. This is almost self explanatory. Context (historical periods) for example is extremely important when it comes to history. This can help us with anything from being able to read sources more properly to understanding and not misinterpreting information from resources because of the *context*.
