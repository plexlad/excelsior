## Gates
The base types of logic gates include NOT, AND, and OR. These are the base components that can be used to create all other kinds of gates. These are very useful 
## Writing and drawing forms for gates
Algebraic Notation for digital circuit functions

These are some of the different ways to explain and show how bit systems work.

$x$ can be considered a switch (or switches) that can be considered binary.

AND: $f_1=x_1x_2$
OR: $f_2=x_1+x_2$
NOT: $f_3=\bar{x_{1}}$ 

## Truth Tables
Truth tables are a way to display the math and conveniently calculate what is going on using a display with a certain kind of table based notation

NOT:

| $x$ | $\bar{x}$ |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 |

AND:

| $x$ | $y$ | $xy$ |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

OR:

| $x$ | $y$ | $x+y$ |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

## Diagram Circuitry

These circuits can be rearranged with lines drawn between them to display digital circuit logic. These components can be arranged in other formats, such as with using chips or transistors to create real world functioning circuits.

## Time Graph

This is a display over time of a triple NAND circuit.

Very good for understanding real time circuits and visualizing the correlation between circuits.
