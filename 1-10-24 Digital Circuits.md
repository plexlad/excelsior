## What is Digital Circuits?
How can we build a computer as an electric circuit? We need a way way to represent input and output.

You can build any function using simple tools. You also need a way to portray and store memory. 

## Digital Hardware
1. Standard chips - These are chips that complete a very specific purpose. Very useful, but can become impractical.
2. Programmable logic device - You can actually program the individual connections inside of these to complete different purposes. They are a little bit slower.
3. Custom designed chips - You can create chips that serve individual purposes, but they are expensive and slow to fabricate, but can be optimized for very specific purposes.

## Different Protocols
There are many ways that binary can be used. For example, ASCII is a protocol that was made to represent latin letters on a keyboard in binary. We can use a table or decimal numbers to represent all of these characters.
