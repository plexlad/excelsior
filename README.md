# Inside Track

From students for students.

A website to build plain text notes into a website that can be accessed by students for reference.

This original source was written in the text editor Obsidian, but other editors can easily be used.

## Technical Details

The stack that IT is built on:

 - Abell (Vite): Statically generated for GitHub hosting, convenience, and ease of use. Abell is built on top of Vite, including prop and plugin support.
 - Markdown: Fantastic plain text formatting. Human readable with massive community support. Files can be written by people with very little programming experience. Markdown can also be compiled to HTML and supports the other features here.
 - LaTeX (Mathjax): Math can be tricky to read especially in a typed text format. While LaTeX can be quite tricky and complicated to work with, the result is much more easy to read. LaTeX is the mathematical notation that can be used, Mathjax is the compiler that allows it to be read on the browser.
 - GitHub: GitHub Pages is great because it allows you to host a statically generated site for free. Using the files generated, we can host a website that is readily accessible to others.
